# DOCUMENT SCANNER

#### Your pocket scanner: effortless A4 document capture and transformation into a clean PDF

## Key Features

#### There's plenty of similar projects, what is it that makes this repository different (and better) ?

- it's purpose is to do _one_ thing, and to do it right
- lightweight (no heavy models), fast and super-easy to use
- the code detects pixels that are supposed to be white and makes them _white_, so that if you need to print the document you don't have to waste ink
- automatically scan all the images in a directory
- choose if you want the result to be colorized or black and white

## How It Works
- Detects the document using OpenCV.
- Applies perspective transformation to align the sheet.  
- Cleans up the background. 
- Saves the processed document as an A4 PDF

## Usage
The photo must contain the 4 corners of the sheet (it will obviously work better if there's nothing else in the picture and if the quality is high), and it has to be vertical.

#### Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/davide710/scanner.git
```
#### Installing Dependences
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Use Case Examples
| Command Line                                              | Description                                            |

|``` python3 src/main.py path/to/image [-c (colorized)] ``` |Scans the image provided by the path                    |
|```python3 src/main.py path/to/folder [-c (colorized)]```  |Scans all images inside the folder provided by the path |
|```python3 src/main.py . [-c (colorized)]```               |Scans all the images within the current directory       |

#### Output
All files generated by the program will be output into the follwing directory:
```

```
#### Supported Formats

## Troubleshooting
###### "File not found! Insert a valid path."
- Ensure the path to the file provided is correct
- Try again with an absolute path


###### "No files were found."
- Verify there are valid files within the folder directory provided


###### For persistent issues
- Replace main.py with doc_scan_click.py found within the test_and_others folder
- You will see your document, where you can then manually click the four corners of the sheet
